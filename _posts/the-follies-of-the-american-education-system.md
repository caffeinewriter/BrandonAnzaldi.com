The American education system is horrilby flawed. Many would proclaim its wonders, by comparing it to third world education systems, which in all fairness, is not very fair. Yes, we have an amazing education infrastructure, but we also seem to decide that the most important thing isn't how much someone is able to apply their skills to their own lives, but how well they place on standardized tests. Those that do poorly on these tests are rarely afforded opportunities to advance, and those that do well, are showered with rewards.

####Testing

I agree that testing does have its place, but not as a pure measure of a person's potential. Testing is unnatural. We're placed into what some people find to be a stressful environment, and made to recite knowledge onto a piece of paper, more often than not, one that's riddled with ways to try and force you into mistakes. Subtle wording changes, similar answers, and innumerable other ways that apparently mean you're less capable as a human being if you trip up on them. I don't get it. When will a boss _ever_ hand you something that will deliberately impede your work? In my opinion, the ability to think creatively is infinitely more important than the ability to work with trick questions.

####Homework

I've heard parents outright refuse to send children to a school, simply because "they don't give enough homework". It is indeed important to be self motivated, which I assume is their reasoning for wanting kids to have hour upon hour of homework, but is it really self motivated if it's required? Kids already spend 8 hours a day listening to teachers lecture on subjects. They take notes, and then they take those notes, and spend hours working on what has been assigned to them beyond the classroom as well. Is extracirricular work important? Hell yes it is, but it shouldn't be forced. It should be more of a measure of a child's self motivation.

####Funding

Despite how proudly we proclaim that our education system is superior, we constantly slash funding to it, while demanding more from teachers and students alike. Drifting back to testing, we incentivize teachers with monetary benefits if their students do so well on these tests. We're not encouraging teachers to teach their students life skills, or to make them enjoy the material they have to learn. We're incentivizing them to cram as much test material into their students' brains as possible, and making sure they can regurgitate it on command. In my opinion, "No Child Left Behind" was a piece of legislation with noble intentions, but in practice, a hinderence to all involved in education, _especially_ in conjunction with the funding cuts that plauge our education system. 

The American education system could be so much better than it is. It really could. Brilliant kids are held back, because they make practical things instead of doing their homework, those who fall in line are rewarded, and there is almost zero potential to be disruptive. To be something more than what you're asked to be. I personally never went to a "traditional" educational institution until I started college. Before that, up through high school even, I was in [Montessori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education) schools, which I found much more practical, and much more engaging than any traditional education system I'd seen or heard of. 

In my mind, education will never be perfect, because there are things we need to learn. I would suggest that we allow kids to start training for what they want to be earlier, but to be honest, children are impulsive. I should know, I've been there. If we did allow that, we'd have a plethora of astronauts, firefighters, and superheroes, but very few who would actually work towards professions that need to be taken care of. I have yet to hear a kid at a pre-secondary age say, "I want to be an accountant," or "I want to be a Pharacy Technician". There are parts of this education system that cannot, or should not be fixed, but there are certainly ways to improve upon the system in place.
